This repo was created to demonstrate my knowledge of Playwright and CI pipelines

The YAML script will run whenever a PUSH or PULL happens within the repo:
https://github.com/max-xdesign/PW-Git-Demo

All tests within the "tests" folder will be run with the command "npx playwright test"
when the YAML script is triggered
